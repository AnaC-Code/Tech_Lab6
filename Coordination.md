*Getting familiar with the data and assigning the tickets aka everyone should understand the data and help with cleaning it
### 2024.07.14.
#### 14:00
*We made an agreement on which data to clean from our set and which to keep, to use 4 various machine learning algorithms to compare our outputs and to make some plots so that we can have graphic representation as well. We will try to do it until Hackaton, if not then on it, so that we can learn from others as well, as much as possible.

*Presentation with the mentor, his feedback is he would love to see more heatmap
api , openstreet api, go pie he likes , group stores into states and create heatmap out of it

*The group decided to try different modeling and see if we can get a good prediction from at least one. if not we have to work within the data set to achieve a better set up
### 2024.08.11.
#### 10:00 
*Meeting to compare the models results and to check if some of them are not working what is wrong
### 2024.08.17.
#### 10:00 
*Second Hackaton, we decided to work on ARIMA Analysis and to try to Enrich the Dataset and run our models again with it
### 2024.08.31.
#### 17:00 
*Meeting to discuss the division of tasks for the final submission
