*We made an agreement on which data to clean from our set and which to keep, to use 4 various machine learning algorithms to compare our outputs and to make some plots so that we can have graphic representation as well. We will try to do it until Hackaton, if not then on it, so that we can learn from others as well, as much as possible.
